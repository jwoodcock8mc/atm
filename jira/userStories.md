###ATM User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to withdraw the money available in my bank account,
which includes the available overdraft.

- As a user, I expect that I will not be able to withdraw more money than is available in 
my combined account balance and overdraft.

- As a user, I want to be able to see my current account balance, so that I know how much
money I can withdraw.

- As a user, I want to be informed that if I ask for more money than is in the ATM machine,
that doing this is not possible.

- As a user, I want to be told if I enter an incorrect PIN number, and prevented from making
withdrawals and balance requests.
